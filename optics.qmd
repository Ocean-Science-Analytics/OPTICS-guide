## **Background**

The OPTically-based In-situ Characterization System ([OPTICS](https://www.integral-corp.com/our-services/oceans/optics/)) revolutionizes water quality monitoring at aquatic sites. This patented technology (U.S. Patent No. 11079368) is a uniquely powerful and cost-effective tool for characterizing contaminants in surface water. OPTICS is used for a wide variety of environmental applications including source control evaluation, dredge plume characterization, and remedy performance monitoring.

OPTICS combines robust aquatic instrumentation and innovative data processing techniques to provide surface water dissolved and particulate concentrations of a wide range of contaminants at unprecedented scales. The novel use of optically-based in-situ monitoring for high-resolution, robust derivation of chemical properties allows for a complete understanding of water quality and contaminant transport in response to natural processes and human impacts.

Benefits of OPTICS:

●     High-resolution surface water contaminant characterization

●     Cost-effective monitoring and assessment tool

●     Versatile and modular with capability for real-time telemetry

●     Development and understanding of conceptual site models

●     Key line of evidence for designing and evaluating remedies

## **Theory**

OPTICS (OPTically-based In-situ Characterization System) integrates commercial, off-the-shelf, in-situ aquatic sensors, periodic discrete surface water sample collection and analysis, and a multi-parameter statistical prediction model to provide high-resolution characterization of surface water chemicals of concern (COCs).

​The principle behind OPTICS is based on the relationship between the optical properties of natural waters, driven by particles and dissolved material in the water column. Surface water chemical contaminants such as PCBs and heavy metals are hydrophobic in nature and sorb to materials in the water column. These materials have unique optical signatures that can be measured using in-situ aquatic optical and water quality sensors, from which biogeochemical properties, such as particle size distribution, concentration, and composition, can be derived. Furthermore, chemical-associated material often covaries with a system’s biophysical processes, which can be assessed using in-situ aquatic sensors. ​ The integration of optical and water quality measurements with analytical chemical samples using robust statistical methods thus provides a means to derive chemical contaminant concentrations at high resolution.

## **OPTICS Measurements**

The physical processes of light interaction with water can be measured in-situ using optical instrumentation. Sensors such as fluorometers, backscattering sensors, laser diffraction sensors, and absorption meters can be strategically placed in aquatic systems to gain valuable information about the types and concentration of particles and dissolved material and particle size distribution. The OPTICS tool makes use of these sensors, along with other aquatic instrumentation, and periodic discrete analytical samples of chemical contaminants to characterize COCs in surface water at high resolution.

## **Resources**

The OPTICS methodology has been effectively utilized for environmental monitoring and remediation purposes in aquatic systems. In the examples below, OPTICS field studies were conducted to characterize contaminant dynamics and quantify contaminant concentrations. This approach facilitates the identification of key processes governing contaminant transport and distribution in these ecosystems, allowing for effective remediation strategies and management practices.
